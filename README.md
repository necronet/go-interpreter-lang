It teach several core concepts such as parsing, AST, evaluation and extending a language. The book can be considere an extensive tutorial with several explanation and paper reference on the fundamental of language design.

## How to get started

This repository is striaghfoward, it contains no external dependencies beyond [core go language](https://go.dev/). So basically the instruction are:

- Ensure you have `go version go1.20.4`
- Clone this repo locally
- use `go build & go run main.go`

The last command will open the REPL in order to start trying the Interpreted language. 

You can go ahead and type aritmetic or boolean expression to get evaluated.
